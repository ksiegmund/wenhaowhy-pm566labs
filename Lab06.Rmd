```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}

library(data.table)
library(dyplyr)

```


Reading file / storing as tibble
```{r}

download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/master/00_mtsamples/mtsamples.csv", "mtsamples.csv", method="libcurl", timeout = 60)

mts<-read.csv("mtsamples.csv")

mts <- as_tibble(mts)

mts
```


```{r}

colnames(mts)

specialties <- mts%>% 
  count(medical_specialty, sort=TRUE)

specialties
#if just count, there is no sorting, add sort for descending order)

```

Plotting most transcribed records by specialty
```{r}
specialties %>% 
  top_n(10)%>%
  ggplot( aes(x= n, y = fct_reorder(medical_specialty, n))) + 
    geom_col()

##graph shows many more surgery transcribed records compared to other specialties
```
Part 2 tokenizing words and find most commonly used 
```{r, cache = TRUE}
mts %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, transcription) %>%
  #anti_join(stop_words, by = c("word")) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(20, n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(n, fct_reorder(word, n))) +
  geom_col()
```


Part 3 tokenizing words and find most commonly used without stopwords
```{r, cache = TRUE}
mts %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, transcription) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by=c("word")) %>%
  filter( !grepl(pattern= "^[0-9]+$", x=word)) %>%
  count(word, sort=TRUE)%>%
  top_n(20,n) %>%
  ggplot( aes(n, fct_reorder(word, n))) + 
    geom_col()
    
```

4 Tokenize into bigrams
```{r bigrams-transcription, cache = TRUE}

mts %>% 
  unnest_ngrams(bigram, transcription, n=2) %>%
  count(bigram, sort=TRUE) %>%
  top_n(20, n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(n, fct_reorder(bigram, n)))+ 
  geom_col()

```


```{r triigrams-transcription, cache = TRUE}

mts %>% 
  unnest_ngrams(tigram, transcription, n=3) %>%
  count(tigram, sort=TRUE) %>%
  top_n(20, n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(n, fct_reorder(tigram, n)))+ 
  geom_col()
```

Q5  Pick a word + find word that comes before and after it

```{r}
ptbigrams <- mts %>% 
  unnest_ngrams(bigram, transcription, n=2)%>%
  separate(bigram, into = c("word1", "word2"), sep= " " ) %>%
  select(word1, word2) %>%
  filter(word1 == "patient" | word2 == "patient")
```

finding the words appearing before patient:

```{r}

ptbigrams %>%
  filter(word2=="patient") %>%
  count(word1, sort=TRUE) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = c("word1" = "word")) %>%
  top_n(5) %>%
knitr::kable().
```

Question 6
Which words are most used in each of the specialties. you can use group_by() and top_n() from dplyr to have the calculations be done within each specialty. Remember to remove stopwords. How about the most 5 used words?

```{r top5 words by specialty, cache= TRUE}
mts %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, transcription) %>%
  group_by(medical_specialty) %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter( !(word %in% stop_words$word) & !grepl(pattern = "^[0-9]+$", x = word)) %>%
  top_n(5, n) %>%
  arrange(medical_specialty, desc(n)) %>%
 knitr::kable()
```



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
